THE TRUTH BEHIND TASMANIAN FOREST DESTRUCTION
AND THE JAPANESE PAPER INDUSTRY
Who Logs Them? Who Buys Them?

A Ranking Report

 
Executive Summary

The ancient and biologically unique forests of

Tasmania—which contain one of the world’s greatest

troves of flora and fauna—are rapidly being destroyed

by the irresponsible logging practices of Australian lumber giant

Gunns Limited and its state supplier, Forestry Tasmania. Gunns

Australia’s Federal Court recently found their practices to be

illegal in Wielangta Forest and driving endangered species to

extinction. This landmark decision raises questions about the

legality of most of Gunns’ logging operations.
