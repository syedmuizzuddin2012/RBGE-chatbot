Common and widespread plant species can change in abundance as a result of timber harvesting practices, with potentially
broad effects on an ecosystem. Yet few studies have quantiﬁed such changes and their effects and as a result, subsequent
management can be poorly deﬁned. Tree-ferns are among a number of vegetative resprouters that have been shown to decline in

. Introduction

The change in abundance of a common plant spe-
cies can potentially have a more serious effect on an
ecosystem than the change in abundance of a spor-
adically occurring or rare species. Flow-on effects are
likely to be numerous (Ough and Murphy, 1996), and
ecosystem functions may change over a wide area. At
present, the management of rare or threatened species
in Victorian forests is addressed in policy documents
