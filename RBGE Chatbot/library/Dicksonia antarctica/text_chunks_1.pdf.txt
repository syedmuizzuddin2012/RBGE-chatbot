Tree ferns are a worldwide group of ancient plants
that dominate the order Cyatheales (Pryer et al.
2004). They are true ferns in that they are ﬂowerless
plants that reproduce by spores, which develop on
the underside of the leaves or fronds, and exhibit
‘circinate vernation’ (Large & Braggins 2004). Tree
ferns can have various growth forms. The term ‘tree
fern’ describes the most common growth form, an
arborescent growth which is a tall, erect rhizome

arborescent growth which is a tall, erect rhizome
