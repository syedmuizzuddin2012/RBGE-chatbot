Abstract

Tree ferns are an important structural component of forests in many countries. However,
because their regeneration is often unrelated to major disturbances, their age is often diffi-
cult to determine. In addition, rates of growth may not be uniform, which further complicates
attempts to determine their age. In this study, we measured 5 years of growth of Cyathea

Overall tree fern growth rates

From our field data, we calculated the overall average growth of C. australis to be 73 (+/- 22)
mm/year of growth (+/- 1 SD) and 33 (+/- 13)mm/year for D. antarctica (Table 2).

Growth rates and initial height

For both C. australis and D. antarctica, initial height in 2009 was the most significant (Btail
<0.001) determinant of growth rates. Cyathea australis grew an additional 5mm each year for
every additional meter in height the tree fern was at the time of the fire. For D. antarctica, the
increase in growth

increase in growth for taller ferns was even greater with an additional 6mm of additional

We did not specifically measure light interception, canopy cover or spore production by
tree ferns. Further research measuring tree ferns in areas subject to different light regimes is
required. Given D. antarctica tends to grow to a height of ~ 5-6m before collapsing, it should
be possible to test whether it is age or height (and therefore access to light) that most strongly
influences growth rate. If old fallen tree ferns grow at the same rate as much younger ferns

Tree ferns are an important element of stand structure and species composition of many for-
ests worldwide. They have numerous key ecological roles such as providing food, nesting sites
and movement pathways for animals and being host sites for a wide diversity of epiphytic
plants. Tree ferns are long lived and are commonly
