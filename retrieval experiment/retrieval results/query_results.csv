the use of whole mapping units to determine
whether areas are old growth. For example, if a
forest area of 300 ha contains 30 ha that
would meet the definition for old growth but
the rest of the mapping unit is dominated by
re-growth, the 30 ha of old growth forest
would not be separately identified. These nar-

Abstract

Common and widespread plant species can change in abundance as a result of timber harvesting practices, with potentially
broad effects on an ecosystem. Yet few studies have quantiﬁed such changes and their effects and as a result, subsequent
management can be poorly deﬁned. Tree-ferns are among a number of vegetative resprout",2,1,1

While tree-ferns are unlikely to become extinct in
forests subjected to timber harvesting, it is clear that
forestry operations have lead to changes in tree-fern
abundance. Forest structure, especially in terms of the
horizontal and vertical distribution of tree-ferns, and
tree-fern size and age distribution, has also been
changed. Such changes",2,1.5,3

Common and widespread plant species can change in abundance as a result of timber harvesting practices, with potentially
broad effects on an ecosystem. Yet few studies have quantiﬁed such changes and their effects and as a result, subsequent
management can be poorly deﬁned. Tree-ferns are among a number of vegetative resprout",2,1,1
2.pdf,350,0,5,"5. What specific silvicultural practice is primarily responsible for the changes in tree-fern abundance, and when did it become the major system practiced?",2.pdf,5,"se changes are likely to be long
term. Survival of individuals through harvesting operations is crucial to the maintenance of the role of tree-ferns as a keystone
species in Wet Forests and simple modiﬁcations to current practices could increase the survival of tree-ferns in clearfelled areas.

Abstract

Common and widespread plant species can change in abundance as a result of timber harvesting practices, with potentially
broad effects on an ecosystem. Yet few studies have quantiﬁed such changes and their effects and as a result, subsequent
management can be poorly deﬁned. Tree-ferns are among a number of vegetative resprout",2,1.5,2

Elevation and aspect had no influence on the growth rate of D. antarctica and C. australis.

Growth rates and geographic location

Other than initial height in 2009, geographic location had the largest effect on growth rates.
Cyathea australis grew most rapidly in the Toolangi region, with the growth rate being 13.8mm/
yr faster than tree ferns in Marysville (Btail = 0.002). Tree ferns in Wallaby Creek grew 11.7mm/

We confirmed that C. australis grows faster than D. antarctica. This is perhaps not surprising
given Cyathea as a genus has many very fast growing species and, on average, have larger

growth measured each year for each meter taller the ferns were at the time of the fire (Table 2).

Growth rates and environmental variables

Environmental variables had limited influence on growth rates in C. australis with no signifi-
cant effect identified for slope, elevation or aspect. In contrast, D. antarctica grew more rapidly
on steeper slopes at a rate of 0.3mm/year for each additional degree in slope (B",2,1,5

slope had a minor effect with D. antarctica growing 0.3mm faster for each additional degree
of slope. Geographic location influenced growth in both species by up to 12 – 14mm/yr. The
most consistent factor influencing growth rate, however, was initial height at the time of the

the rest of the mapping unit is dominated by

As already pointed out, these tree ferns are from a temperate rainforest habitat. This means 
they require lots of water to thrive. They can grow well in mild parts of western Britain, where 
we have our own temperate rainforest, now reduced to about 1 percent of the UK, down 
from an original cover of about 20 percent. Many places where these tree ferns are planted 
are ",2,1,1
8.pdf,500,0,3,2. Why are Tasmanian soft tree ferns popular for gardening in the UK?,8.pdf,3,"not within the British temperate rainforest zone. Many will experience unfavourable hot 
and dry summers. The only way these ferns will survive is if they are provided with regular 
and heavy irrigation, which is not sustainable. We often hear of the strain being placed on

for epiphytes and also provides shelter for more delicate fern species to flourish underneath.

V. The Inadequacy of

AFS Certification Vs.
the Forest

Many of the woodchips produced in Tasmania
are certified under the Australian Forestry
Standard (AFS), which is a timber certifica-
tion scheme developed in Australia and
designed specifically to provide legal cove",2,1,3
7.pdf,500,25,5,6. How does the Australian Forestry Standard (AFS) certification process account for the protection of species like Dicksonia antarctica?,7.pdf,98,"t
the AFS for years. Conservationists and environ-
mental NGOs in Australia have opposed the AFS
scheme since 2001 due to the fact that the forestry
officials who dominate the AFS standard-setting
process have refused to adopt legitimate sustainable
standards, specifically to ensure that high conserva-
tion value forests were protected and that wood
arising from the conversion of forests to farmland
or plantations could not be branded as sustainable
by AFS. 

Given that the Australia Forestry St",2,1,3

Tasmania’s wildlife. Hence, the AFS may serve
as a certificate of legality under the slack regu-
lations explained above, but it is hardly proof
of sustainable forest management. The AFS
scheme differs entirely from the Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC) certification
scheme promoted by most NGOs.  

The AFS certification scheme lacks a bal-

rates dependent on initial height were unexpected and we discuss possible reasons for this

height by average growth rate are likely to underestimate the age of short tree ferns, while
overestimating the age of tall tree ferns, particularly if they have been subject to a fire.

as a certificate of legality under the slack regu-

of sustainable forest management. The AFS

Abstract

Common and widespread plant species can change in abundance as a result of timber harvesting practices, with potentially
broad effects on an ecosystem. Yet few studies have quantiﬁed such changes and their effects and as a result, subsequent
management can be poorly deﬁned. Tree-ferns are among a number of vegetative resprout",3,2,5

Common and widespread plant species can change in abundance as a result of timber harvesting practices, with potentially
broad effects on an ecosystem. Yet few studies have quantiﬁed such changes and their effects and as a result, subsequent
management can be poorly deﬁned. Tree-ferns are among a number of vegetative resprout",3,2,5

forests subjected to timber harvesting, it is clear that
forestry operations have lead to changes in tree-fern
abundance. Forest structure, especially in terms of the

Dicksonia antarctica grows best in areas of rainfall of over 1,000 mm per year but in lower rainfall areas
does well in moist gullies. It is tolerant of fire and re-shoots readily after re-location. It can provide habitat

our results.

Cultivation

Dicksonia antarctica grows best in areas of rainfall of over 1,000 mm per year but in lower rainfall areas
does well in moist gullies. It is tolerant of fire and re-shoots readily after re-location. It can provide habitat
for epiphytes and also provides shelter for more delicate fern species to flourish underneath.

Substrate for epiphytes

(Appendix S2)

Together, tree ferns and their epiphytic species in
wet eucalypt forests play a key role in the ecology of
forests through habitat provision, rainfall funnelling
and moisture retention (Scott 1994). In Australia,
there are many studies that consider epiphytes on

and use as nursery sites for new growth (Chesterﬁeld

keystone species in the Victorian Tree-fern Manage-
ment Plan (DNRE 2001), principally because once
stems exceed 1.5–2 m, they are often unique sub-
strates for epiphytes such as orchids, ferns and bryo-
phytes. Vascular plant epiphytes account for 9% of
all vascular plant species (Zotz 2013) with greater

Substrate for epiphytes

(Appendix S2)

Together, tree ferns and their epiphytic species in
wet eucalypt forests play a key role in the ecology of
forests through habitat provision, rainfall funnelling
and moisture retention (Scott 1994). In Australia,
there are many studies that consider epiphytes on

Cultivation

Dicksonia antarctica grows best in areas of rainfall of over 1,000 mm per year but in lower rainfall areas
does well in moist gullies. It is tolerant of fire and re-shoots readily after re-location. It can provide habitat
for epiphytes and also provides shelter for more delicate fern species to flourish underneath.

The  results  of  this  study  indicate:  (i)  that  Dicksonia
antarctica  exhibits  a  strong  response  to VPD;  (ii)  that
increasing VPD negatively affects maximum net photo-
synthesis  and  quantum  yield  of  photosynthesis;  (iii)
that  low  stomatal  conductance  limits  photosynthesis;

4.1. Implications of tree-fern decline for other
species

An important implication of tree-fern decline is the
impact on the many other species that rely on tree-fern
trunks as substrate for germination or growth (see
Ough and Murphy, 1996; Ashton, 2000). Several
authors have reported reduced occurrence or absence
of epiphytic ferns after harvesting (e.g. Harris, 1989;

In addition to the abundance of individual associated
species, the functioning of ecosystems will undoubt-
edly change with the decrease in abundance of tree-
ferns. No other Wet Forest plants are physiognomically
similar to tree-ferns. Moisture and temperature within

the lower strata (including soil), light regimes, litter

microclimates and forest processes. As tree-fern recruitment is low and growth rates are slow, these changes are likely to be long
term. Survival of individuals through harvesting operations is crucial to the maintenance of the role of tree-ferns as a keystone
species in Wet Forests and simple modiﬁcations to current practices could increase the ",8.5,7,9

overestimating the age of tall tree ferns, particularly if they have been subject to a fire.

We confirmed that C. australis grows faster than D. antarctica. This is perhaps not surprising
given Cyathea as a genus has many very fast growing species and, on average, have larger
crown spread than Dicksonia [16].This may in part be due to C. australis having a greater spe-

4. Discussion

Tree-ferns declined signiﬁcantly in abundance after
clearfell harvesting operations. Across the six study
coupes, 16% of the tree-ferns on 23 monitored plots
remained alive 1 year after seedbed preparation. The

tree-ferns 150–

decline was greater than 90% in all height classes.

Overall, 5% of tree-ferns in plots pre-harvest remained
in an upright position 1-year post-harvest. The number
of prostrate and buried living tree-fern trunks
increased substantially after clearfelling.

impact on the many other species that rely on tree-fern
trunks as substrate for germination or growth (see

Anatomy and biology

These ferns can grow to 15 m (49 ft) in height, but more typically grow to about 4.5–5 m (15–16 ft), and
consist of an erect rhizome forming a trunk. They are very hairy at the base of the stip",10,8.5,10
